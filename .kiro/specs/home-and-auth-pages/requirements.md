# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive authentication system for the MAIS Inventory Management System. The system will include a home page with login functionality, a dedicated login page, and a forgot password feature. All pages will be in English and fully integrated with the existing PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM and NextAuth.js authentication framework.

## Glossary

- **System**: The MAIS Inventory Management System web application
- **User**: Any person attempting to access the system
- **Admin_User**: A user with ADMIN role privileges (yazeed@mais.com)
- **Auth_Service**: NextAuth.js authentication service
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database accessed via Prisma ORM
- **Home_Page**: The root page at /app/page.tsx
- **Login_Page**: The authentication page at /src/app/[locale]/login/page.tsx
- **Dashboard**: The main application interface at /src/app/[locale]/dashboard
- **Session**: An authenticated user session managed by NextAuth.js
- **Forgot_Password_Page**: Page for password reset requests

### Requirement 6: Database Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all authentication operations to interact with the PostgreSQL database, so that user data is persisted and secure.
